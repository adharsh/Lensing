^ make super modular, make it easy to test each step of the way

3) Start 
Definitely important:

Start writing from scratch


1. Make a window

Algorithm:

Rendering ice basically


When creating normal image, use some kind of interpolation method
	Normal avergae to make it smooth across each normal image
	spline, etc.
When considering layers
	Consider: https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing
	Finding out depth using formulas shown here
	Use that in computation -> maybe adjust angle for refract, etc.
When trying to copy buffers are sub sample them:
	https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Advanced-Data


Maybe through some math combine into one lens at the end? Then render that?
Instead of all of these lens going through one at a time

Geometry shaders I guess if you want to visualize normals

Uniform buffer objects, (definitely) the tech demo split screen thing:
